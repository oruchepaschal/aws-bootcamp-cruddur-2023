# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Required Assignments

For week 1, I was able to create the Docker files for
both backend and frontend applications and run them

## Homework stretch

- Completed all requirements for week 1
- Delved deep into container security concepts, and grasping and practicing the concepts of container image security
- discovered vulnerabilities in bootcamp docker compose file using Synk vulnerability scanner (email notification and dashboard report)
- practiced further on containerizing apps
- built images and pushed to the most popular free container registry, Dockerhub
- some a blocker I in running the frontend container, but fixed it

Encountered exiting error whilst trying to start the frontend container, investigating further and realized I hadn't installed the node modules. 

error logs below:
