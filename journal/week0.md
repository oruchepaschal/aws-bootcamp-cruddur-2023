# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Assignment
* **Done**: I am done with 70% of my required assignments as at now, heading towards completion
* **Blockers**: I had a conference to prepare as a sponsor and speaker the past week, and was a two day event on the 17th and 18th, hence, this made me loose days of work.


## Homework challenges
* **1**: I was able to design a CI/CD pipeline for the project
* **2**: I created an IAM role with admin privileges.
* **3** Setup MFA for my AWS cloud console
* **4** Admin user created
